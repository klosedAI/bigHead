Are you annoyed by endless stream of clickbaity articles? Articles like "You won't believe what happened next" or "10 things you should know about X" optimized for SEO maxing. Well, my friends and I at klosedAI, a fully open-source platform, decided to do something about it. We introduce BigHead, a chrome extension. BigHead reads the article for you and hightlights the most important and relevant information on the website. Bighead also chats with you in case you want to learn more about the current article you are on. You can finally learn 10 things about X without having to scroll through 10 pages.

Bighead will soon be available on chrome extension store. It's free and open source, you can find the code on out github [here](https://github.com/klosedAI/bighead)
