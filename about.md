## Inspiration
We were browsing through why Sama got fired from OpenAI and realized all the news articles were click baity and had a lot of irrelevant information. We wanted to create a tool that would highligh important parts of the article and give you the most important information. We also wanted to create a chatbot help for the article to help you understand the article better.

## What it does
It highlights the most important parts of the article and gives you a summary of the article. It also has a chatbot that can answer questions about the article.

## How we built it
We created a chrome extension that reads the information on the website and uses Claude AI APIs to get relevant information. We used Claude AI APIs to create a chatbot that can answer questions about the article. We created the extension using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The user gets to add their own Claude AI API keys to use the extension.

## Challenges we ran into
Highlihgting the website turned out to be the hardest part of development since we had to take care of different tags, websites, and styles. We also had to make sure that the extension worked on all websites. We also had to make sure that the extension was easy to use and had a good user interface.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We think great products are the ones that you would use yourself. We are proud of the fact that we were able to create a product that we would use ourselves.

## What's next for bighead
We want to make the extension have persistency across websites. This would be helpful in understanding the context of the articles that the user is reading. This would make it easier to create better UX.
